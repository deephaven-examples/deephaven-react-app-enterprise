# Example Deephaven Enterprise React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite using the react-ts template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). It is to provide an example React application connecting to Deephaven and displaying a table of data within a dashboard.

## Quick Start

You need to set the ENV variables defined in [.env](./.env). Change them in `.env`, or you can override them with a local `.env.local` file which is ignored by git. After those are set, simply run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Your development server will start up. You can then open up the URL in your browser and you should see a table appear.
